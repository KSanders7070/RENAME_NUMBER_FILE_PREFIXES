# RENAME_NUMBER_FILE_PREFIXES

This BATCH File will take every number sequenced file name and rename it starting with 100001
and increasing by 100 for each file.

This will only work if the file starts with a sequency number followed immediately
by an underscore:

   EX:
      100020_Some name_here.txt
      1_Some name_here and stuff.xml

This BATCH File MUST be in the same directory with all of the files that you wish to rename.
